        We are a small community of engineers who enjoy working on side projects, with a focus on shipping. Our core values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>always be learning</li>
        <li>done is better than perfect</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The community consists of a Slack chatroom, Facebook group, and monthly meetups. Our goal as members is to hold each other accountable, share our products with each other, and build a network of enthusiastic builders. In an effort to keep the quality high with active and committed community members, you must be invited to join.

        *"20% time" is a concept popularized by tech companies that helps instill in their engineering culture the commitment towards learning, self-improvement, and experimentation, by allowing employees to spend 1/5th of their time working on whatever interests them.
